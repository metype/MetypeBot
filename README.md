# MetypeBot
The repo for the MetypeBot discord bot.

To run this bot, use the `node .` command inside the directory. This bot does require node.

The only extra file you will need it `bot_info.json`, which should look something like this:

```json
{
    "token" : "<Your Bot's Token>",
    "prefix" : "!",
    "owner" : [
        "<Your Discord ID>"
    ]
    
}
```

This file is inside the gitignore for security reasons.
